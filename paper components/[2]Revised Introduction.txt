Revised Introduction
Image classification has witnessed significant advancements with the advent of deep learning techniques. However, achieving optimal performance often requires careful consideration of factors such as data preprocessing and augmentation. In this study, we investigate the impact of these techniques on classification accuracy and explore the benefits of ensemble learning.

Data preprocessing and augmentation play a crucial role in enhancing model performance. By addressing issues like noise, inconsistencies, and limited dataset size, these techniques can improve generalization and reduce overfitting. Our research aligns with previous findings that highlight the correlation between better data quality and improved classification results.

To further optimize our classification model, we employed ensemble learning. This approach combines multiple base learners, each trained on different subsets of the data, to produce a more robust and accurate prediction. By leveraging the strengths and weaknesses of individual models, ensembles can often outperform any single model.

Our ensemble technique incorporates [bagging]. Bagging is used with decision trees, where it significantly raises the stability of models in improving accuracy and reducing variance, which eliminates the challenge of overfitting. Bagging in ensemble machine learning takes several weak models, aggregating the predictions to select the best prediction. By Bagging it was easy to tackle problems like overfitting and getting better results than other ensemble techniques, we aimed to enhance classification accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.

To streamline the process and reduce complexity, we avoided tuning hyperparameters for our base learners. Instead, we relied on pre-trained models and focused on optimizing the ensemble strategy. This approach allowed us to achieve competitive results without excessive computational overhead.

As base learners, we utilized state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including ResNet, DenseNet, ShuffleNet, MobileNet, and EfficientNet. These models, pre-trained on large-scale datasets like ImageNet, provide a strong foundation for our classification task. By combining the strengths of these diverse models, our ensemble approach can capture a wider range of patterns and improve generalization.
