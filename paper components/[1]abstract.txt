Abstract:
In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have significantly advanced the field of image classification, with the understanding that higher accuracy of base learners can contribute more effectively to ensemble outputs. This paper builds upon existing research, notably the study titled "Weighted Ensemble Model for Image Classification," [research paper link here (previous)] which demonstrated that models with higher accuracy have a greater contribution to the final ensemble model performance. Our approach involves training multiple state-of-the-art architectures, including ResNet, DenseNet, ShuffleNet, MobileNet, and EfficientNet, and employing an ensemble technique to enhance classification accuracy. We applied comprehensive data preprocessing and augmentation strategies to the same X-ray image dataset of COVID-19, resulting in a significant increase in three-class accuracy compared to existing models in the literature. Our findings confirm that effective data handling not only improves individual model performance but also amplifies the overall effectiveness of ensemble methods. This research contributes valuable insights into optimizing ensemble techniques for image classification tasks and sets a foundation for future explorations in this domain.
